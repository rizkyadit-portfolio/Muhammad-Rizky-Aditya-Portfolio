    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a target-driven professional transitioning from a 3-year career as a barista to data analysis. 
      With hands-on experience analyzing daily sales forecasts and inventory trends, I developed a solid 
      foundation in data-driven decision-making. Currently, I am strengthening my technical expertise in 
      Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau. My strengths in collaboration, problem-solving, and communication 
      enable me to deliver actionable insights, and I am eager to contribute meaningfully as a data analyst.
