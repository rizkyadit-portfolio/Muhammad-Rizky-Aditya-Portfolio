    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a target-driven professional transitioning from a 3-year career as a barista to data analysis. 
      During my time in the hospitality industry, I honed strong problem-solving, teamwork, and communication 
      skills while also gaining experience analyzing daily sales forecasts and inventory trends. These 
      experiences sparked my passion for data-driven decision-making and inspired me to pursue data analytics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I am strengthening my technical expertise in <b>Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau</b> to turn raw 
      data into meaningful insights. My hands-on projects include business analysis, financial dashboarding, 
      and retail sales performance evaluation, where I apply data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and 
      visualization techniques to provide actionable recommendations. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My career goal is to leverage my analytical skills, creativity, and adaptability to help organizations 
      make smarter decisions, improve performance, and achieve growth. With a foundation in both customer-facing 
      service and technical analysis, I bring a unique perspective that bridges business needs with data solutions.
